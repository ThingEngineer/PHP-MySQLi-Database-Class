hi,

I think there is a bug in your script. Following, my explanation:
I've tryed to do this:

	$db->where("id", "'$login'");
	$req = $db->getOne(DB_TABLE_USERS);
	
then, getOne() call get() method, then get() method call _buildQuery() method.
Inside _buildQuery, there is a line:

  $this->_lastQuery = $this->replacePlaceHolders ($this->_query, $this->_bindParams);

and, following this call, _query and _lastQuery have value:

  $this->_query is equals to "SELECT * FROM users WHERE   id = ?  LIMIT 1", and
  $this->_lastQuery is equals to "SELECT * FROM users WHERE   id = 'flenain'"

then, the following line inside _buildQuery:

  $stmt = $this->_prepareQuery();

fire an error here inside _prepareQuery:

  if (!$stmt = $this->_mysqli->prepare($this->_query)) {

because, $this->_query is equals to "SELECT * FROM users WHERE   id = ?  LIMIT 1", which is not a valid sql query.

I guess, inside _buildQuery, the line:

  $this->_lastQuery = $this->replacePlaceHolders ($this->_query, $this->_bindParams);

should be:

  $this->_lastQuery = $this->_query = $this->replacePlaceHolders ($this->_query, $this->_bindParams);

so $this->_query will not be "SELECT * FROM users WHERE   id = ?  LIMIT 1", but "SELECT * FROM users WHERE   id = 'flenain'"
